## Output files

### <output_file_prefix>.txt
This file contains generated matrix.

*Format:*

The first row is the number of rows followed by the number of columns. Subsequent rows start with the row name followed by matrix row.

*Example:*

```bash
10 5
sp1 1 1 1 1 0
sp2 1 1 1 0 1
sp3 0 1 1 0 1
sp4 1 1 1 1 0
sp5 1 1 0 1 1
sp6 1 1 0 0 0
sp7 1 1 1 0 0
sp8 1 0 1 1 1
sp9 0 0 0 1 0
sp10 0 0 1 0 0
```

### <output_file_prefix>.log

**Matrix Summary**

Here, we will describe the matrix summary on the above example.

*Basic info:*
* `n = 10` - the number of rows  
* `k = 5`  - the number of columns
* `#0 = 20` - the number of zeros in the matrix
* `%0 = 60%` - the % of zeros out of all `n x k` matrix entries

*Rows and columns sum summaries:*
* `row_sum_counts: [0 2 1 2 5 0]` - Entries correspond to the number of rows with `row sum = i-1`, where `i` is the position in the vector. The length of the vector is `k+1`. 


`row_sum_counts`, the number of rows with corresponding sum | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 0
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
corresponding row sum, i-1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5


* `col_sum_counts: [0 0 0 0 1 1 0 3 0 0 0]` - Entries correspond to the number of columns with `column sum = i-1`, where `i` is the position in the vector. The length of the vector is `n+1`. 

`col_sum_counts`, the number of columns with corresponding column sum | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
corresponding column sum, i-1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10


*Columns involved in rows with minimal information (row sum = 1):*
* `col_counts_row_sum_1: [3 2 0]` - Entries correspond to the number of columns, which contain 1's in `i-1` rows with row sum = 1. The length of the vector is `u+1`. Here, there are 3 columns, which have only zeros in the rows with row sum = 1 (rows sp9 and sp10) and there are 2 columns, thjat each have 1 in one row with row sum = 1 (in our example, third and fourth columns have 1's in sp10 and sp9, respectivelly). 



## Input file (optional)

### <input_file_name>

This file should be either empty or with matrix summaries of previously generated matrices. Such summaries are generated by the matrix simulator, which updates input file, when the matrix is generated. If the fils is empty, the simulator just adds the matrix summary of the current matris. If the files is not empty, the simulator checks, if the currently generated matrix has the same summary as any other matrix in the input file. If yes, it means that matrices might be identical after row and/or column shuffling. In this case, the simulator will generate another matrix. The number of trials (i.e. how many times the simulator attempts generating matrix, with different matrix summary) is controlled via option `-t <num>`.

*Example:*

```
10 5 20 40.0 [0 2 1 2 5 0][0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 1 0][3 2 0]
10 5 20 40.0 [0 2 1 2 5 0][0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 1 0][3 2 0]
10 5 20 40.0 [0 2 1 2 5 0][0 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 0][3 2 0]
```

Note: There are matrix summaries of three matrices, which were generated using the same input parameters. Since the spread of zeros in the matrices is different (here, reflected in different column sums counts), these matrices are different.
